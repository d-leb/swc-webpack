# swc-webpack

A library for compiling TypeScript and JavaScript using SWC and Webpack. SWC is an extensible Rust-based platform used for both compilation and bundling. Webpack is static module bundler.
This library can bootstrap a project with default configurations and allows you to customize settings in a non-proprietary way. This library is designed to be used as a dependency in a
project. It is not designed to be used as a standalone project. If you have suggestions or have any problems, please open an issue on the
[d-leb/swc-webpack issues board](https://github.com/d-leb/swc-webpack/issues).
